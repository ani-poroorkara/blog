## Hi buddies! You've made it! Again!! 

From the idea of the name itself, this is a log file of my recreational activities.

#### The beginning

At first, this was strictly serving the purpose of being a publication for my ongoing and done projects so that I can log all my findings and learning directly on a webpage so that I can be shared on my resume or wherever... So after a week-long thought, why not write about everything and anything?

#### Three weeks later.. Here's logFile :D

#### Quick View 

Let’s get you a quick run-through of all the sections on this page (what else would I write in this post :/??)

- Category <br>
    I plan on categorizing each of my posts so that similar posts can be quickly found on this page. I’ll also add a category button on each of the posts so that one can quickly navigate directly to that particular category.

- Archive <br>
    chronological order. But why?? Cause I could and it seemed like a good idea while I was developing the blog.

- About <br>
    I'll let you guys figure this one out. 
	
The goal of this post is simple - to inspire me to write regularly (probably once a week.. maybe..). So here’s to hoping for a continuous and consistent list of posts, publications, and fiction.

That's it! Until next time :D!
