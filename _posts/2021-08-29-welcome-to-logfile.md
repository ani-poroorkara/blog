## Hey Guys! You've made it! Again!! 

As the name suggests, this is a log file of my recreational activities.

#### The beginning

Initially, this was going to be a publication for my ongoing and completed projects. A space to record all my research and learning directly on a webpage for it to be later shared on my resume or wherever. Thinking it over, I decided, why limit myself when I can write about everything and anything?

#### Three weeks later.. Here's logFile :D

The goal of this post is simple - to inspire me to write regularly (probably once a week, maybe). So here’s to hoping for a continuous and consistent list of posts, publications, and fiction.

#### Quick View 

Let’s get you a quick run-through of all the sections on this page (what else would I write in this post? :/)

- Category <br>
    My blog isn't based on one particular niche. From technical to fantasy-fiction, I'll be flitting between multiple genres. After a point, it'll be difficult to keep track of all these posts, so why not categorize them for quick navigation? And guess what? I’ll also add a category button on each of the posts so it’s easier to hop on to that particular category.

- Archive <br>
    All my posts are in chronological order. Don’t we just love it when things are organized according to date and time? <3 
- About <br>
    I'll let you guys figure this one out. 
	


That's it! Until next time :D!
