## Pages

> In the context of a website or a document, a "page" usually refers to a single unit of content that can be accessed by the user through a navigation menu or a hyperlink. A page can contain various types of content such as text, images, videos, links, and interactive elements, and is typically designed to provide information or functionality on a specific topic. - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

### The Start

At first, this was where I would publish and document my learnings and completed projects. A safe-space to record all my research and development which can later be shared on my resume or wherever. But then... *why stop there?*

The goal of this post is simple - to inspire me to write regularly (probably once a week, maybe). So here’s to hoping for a continuous and consistent list of posts, publications, and fiction.

#### Quick View 

Let’s get you a quick run-through of all the sections on this page (what else would I write in this post? :/)

- Category <br>
    My blog isn't based on one particular niche. From technical to fantasy-fiction, I'll be flitting between multiple genres. After a point, it'll be difficult to keep track of all these posts, so why not categorize them for quick navigation?

- Archive <br>
    All my posts are in chronological order. Don’t we just love it when things are organized according to date and time?

- About <br>
    I'll let you guys figure this one out?
