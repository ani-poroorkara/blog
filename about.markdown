## Hii Buddies! You've made it!

I'm ecstatic to have you *here* in my world of tech-talk and hopefully some good fun filled fictional tales. I'm Anirudh, full time student, software engineer and a regular video gamer. When I am not doing any of the former, I prefer write stuff.

If you want to talk shop or simply engage with me, I would love to hear from you! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-poroorkara-34900017b/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aniporoorkara/). I also have a [professional website](https://ani-poroorkara.github.io/) (if you require that sort of thing?). If nothing works out, I guess you can send me a mail at <anirudh_p@outlook.com>. 

That's it. Enjoy your time here!
