## Hii Buddies! You've made it!

I'm ecstatic to have you *here* and read my material. I'm Anirudh, a full-time student, a software engineer(if employed or I just play video games), and an occasional author as a part of doing something of a hobby. 

If you want to connect with me regarding posts or in general, I would love to hear from you! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-poroorkara-34900017b/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aniporoorkara/). I also have a [professional website](https://ani-poroorkara.github.io/) (if you require that sort of thing?). If nothing works out, I guess you can send me a mail at <anirudh_p@outlook.com>. 

>That's it. Enjoy your time here!
