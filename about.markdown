# You are [here](https://ani-poroorkara.github.io/blog/)!

Hey there, welcome to my blog - **Pages**! It's so great to have you here, and I CANNOT wait to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

This blog is all about exploring different topics, from personal growth and development to the latest movies. I love learning new things and now I plan on sharing it with you. 

I am Anirudh, full-time computer engineer, part-time reader, video-gamer and now writer? You can know more about me [here](https://ani-poroorkara.github.io/). I've always been about trying new ideas and perspectives, and I hope to inspire you to do the same. Whether you're looking for practical tips or just a good read, I'm sure that you'll find something of value here.

You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-poroorkara-34900017b/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aniporoorkara/), and I'd be more than happy to chat. And if all else fails, you can send me an email at <anirudhporoorkara@gmail.com> *(Please don't?!)*.
